\title{Compute binary probabilities for deterministic forecasts}
\usage{
det_probabilities(
  .fcst,
  parameter,
  thresholds,
  comparator = c("ge", "gt", "le", "lt", "eq", "between", "outside"),
  include_low = TRUE,
  include_high = TRUE,
  obs_probabilities = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.fcst}{A \code{harp_list} object with \code{harp_det_point_df} deta frames,
or a \code{harp_det_point_df} data frame.}

\item{parameter}{The name of the column for the observed data.}

\item{thresholds}{A numeric vector of thresholds for which to compute
probabilities.}

\item{obs_probabilities}{A logical indicating whether or not to compute the
binary probabilities for the observations.}
}
\value{
An object of the same class as \code{.fcst} with columns for threshold,
fcst_prob and optionally obs_prob instead of the raw forecast column.
